# 0001 - Use Github for source code storage

Date: 2022-08-18

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We want to store our source code in a open source, cloud based git provider.

## Ethics

There are other providers we could use, but doing so would not bring any great benefit over our already established best practices for existing services.

We can move to any other provider should we wish due to git being an open standard.

Having our code on Github as a Public repository allows others to learn from and contribute to our work. This could include anyone from students learning to big corporations wanting to use and contribute.

Allowing the access of our code via the platform will encourage others to be able to help contribute and reuse our services built.

The more we can share with others, the stronger our solutions will be.

We should ensure that our repositories are marked as Open Source as soon as we feel comfortable.

With our code in the open, people can gain trust that we are not abusing their data or privacy and help identify any potential security issues we may miss.

We should never store any Personal Identifiable Information into our Repository nor any secrets committed.

### Decision

We should use Github for storing our source code.

### Consequences

We will be open source from the start.

If we use other Github features such as Actions, we must be aware that we cannot move to another provider quickly without first replacing built in functionality with another tool.
