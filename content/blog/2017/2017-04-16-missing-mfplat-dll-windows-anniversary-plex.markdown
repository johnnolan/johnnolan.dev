So, I got the lovely new Windows Anniversary update last night. Logged on
this morning and first error I get is when Plex Media Server loaded up.

I got an error saying I was missing the MFPlat.dll.

## To Fix (tl;dr;)

* Download the [Media Feature Pack for N edition of Windows 10 Version 1703](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4016817/media-feature-pack-for-n-edition-of-windows-10-version-1703-april-2017)
* Install it
* Reboot
* Profit

You should now be up and running.

Short one but hope it helps someone out there.
