<p>You can see the final Ethics ADR template and a copy of this decision in the <a href="https://github.com/johnnolan/johnnolan.dev/tree/main/docs/adrs">docs folder of this Github repository</a>.</p>
<h2 id="introduction" tabindex="-1">Introduction</h2>
<p>I have had the privilege to have worked with a Digital Sociologist recently who introduced me to the concept of Tech Ethics.</p>
<p>One of my passions in development is front end performance and the concept of tech privilege (this will be another post in the future). This introduced me to a wider view on ethics in development.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.modernising.opg.service.justice.gov.uk/research-development/articles/tech-ethic-decisions/">A blog post by Lisa Talia Moretti titled &quot;Tech Ethic Decisions&quot;</a> introduces the concept and I instantly began to wonder how you could take this and apply it to a teams every day working.</p>
<p>In this article we will be using these guidelines, so I recommend you pause to take time to read her article.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;When we design digital products and services, we think about the impact weâ€™re having on the systems in which people live their lives&quot; - Lisa Talia Moretti</p>

<h3 id="what-is-an-architectural-decision-record-(adr)%3F" tabindex="-1">What is an Architectural Decision Record (ADR)?</h3>
<p><a href="https://cognitect.com/authors/MichaelNygard.html">Michael Nygard</a> talks in detail in his blog post <a href="https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions">&quot;Documenting Architecture Decisions&quot;</a></p>
<p>Architectural Decision Records are a way of leaving an historical view of decisions made and why they were made during the development of a service.</p>
<p>This gives the following advantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Remembering at a later date why you made a decisions</li>
<li>The ability to revisit and update your decisions</li>
<li>New team members are able to understand why decisions have been made and onboard quickly</li>
<li>When shared publicly, gives an opportunity for others to help with alternative solutions</li>
</ul>
<p>An ADR is laid out in a simple format to make it light weight and quick to fill in. It consists of the following sections.</p>
<ul>
<li>Title
<ul>
<li>Short name of the decision you are talking about.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Context
<ul>
<li>The situation you find yourself in that has raised the need for the decision.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Decision
<ul>
<li>A &quot;We will...&quot; description of what you will do.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Status
<ul>
<li>A status of the decision, this includes Accepted, Rejected, Proposed, Deprecated and Superseded.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Consequences
<ul>
<li>Any downstream consequences, positive or negative, that will be caused by this decision.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="first-version-of-adding-tech-ethics-to-adrs" tabindex="-1">First version of adding Tech Ethics to ADRs</h2>
<p>The first version of adding Tech Ethics was to add all the sub headings to the ADR template.</p>
<pre class="markdown">- Title
- Context
- Ethics
  - Mitigate against being tech deterministic
  - Ensure you conduct inclusive research
  - Think big and imagine what the impact of your work can be
  - Interrogate your data decisions
- Decision
- Status
- Consequences
</pre>
<p>The main aim of ADRs is to be as concise as possible and after testing this in a Service called <a href="https://docs.modernising.opg.service.justice.gov.uk/adr/articles/0002-verifiable-credentials/">Modernising Lasting Power of Attorney</a> it felt too complex.</p>
<p>After learning from this, I propose a simpler version of just having Ethics as a section with the sub headings being prompts.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-setup-tech-ethics-in-architectural-decision-records" tabindex="-1">How to setup Tech Ethics in Architectural Decision Records</h2>
<p>We want to use the four top level sections of Tech Ethics and use them as points of reference.</p>
<p>We should have one section called Ethics.</p>
<p>We should include in comments on the ADR template, a link to the original article and the list of sub headings as a prompt.</p>
<p>Below is a template of how this could look. It is in a gist so please feel free to take this or suggest edits.</p>
<p>The final ADR template that I use can be found in this repository at <a href="https://github.com/johnnolan/johnnolan.dev/tree/main/docs/adrs/0000-adr-template.md">https://github.com/johnnolan/johnnolan.dev/tree/main/docs/adrs/0000-adr-template.md</a></p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/johnnolan/5a650b3f376cb88012ca289680185dac.js"></script>
<h2 id="example-adr" tabindex="-1">Example ADR</h2>
<p>Below is an example of what an Architectural Decision Record with Tech Ethics looks like.</p>
<p>You can see the template and a copy of this decision in the <a href="https://github.com/johnnolan/johnnolan.dev/tree/main/docs/adrs">docs folder of this Github repository</a>.</p>
<h1 id="0001---use-github-for-source-code-storage" tabindex="-1">0001 - Use Github for source code storage</h1>
<p>Date: 2022-08-18</p>
<h2 id="status" tabindex="-1">Status</h2>
<p>Accepted</p>
<h2 id="context" tabindex="-1">Context</h2>
<p>We want to store our source code in a open source, cloud based git provider.</p>
<h2 id="ethics" tabindex="-1">Ethics</h2>
<p>There are other providers we could use, but doing so would not bring any great benefit over our already established best practices for existing services.</p>
<p>We can move to any other provider should we wish due to git being an open standard.</p>
<p>Having our code on Github as a Public repository allows others to learn from and contribute to our work. This could include anyone from students learning to big corporations wanting to use and contribute.</p>
<p>Allowing the access of our code via the platform will encourage others to be able to help contribute and reuse our services built.</p>
<p>The more we can share with others, the stronger our solutions will be.</p>
<p>We should ensure that our repositories are marked as Open Source as soon as we feel comfortable.</p>
<p>With our code in the open, people can gain trust that we are not abusing their data or privacy and help identify any potential security issues we may miss.</p>
<p>We should never store any Personal Identifiable Information into our Repository nor any secrets committed.</p>
<h3 id="decision" tabindex="-1">Decision</h3>
<p>We should use Github for storing our source code.</p>
<h3 id="consequences" tabindex="-1">Consequences</h3>
<p>We will be open source from the start.</p>
<p>If we use other Github features such as Actions, we must be aware that we cannot move to another provider quickly without first replacing built in functionality with another tool.</p>
