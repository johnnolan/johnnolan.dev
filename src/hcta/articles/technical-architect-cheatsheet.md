## Overview

I have decided, for my own sanity, to try and document as much detail on all the areas of what I have to think about on a daily basis as a Technical Architect.

This is to help me as a reference point to ensure I haven't forgotten something at a critical point in a meeting.

I wanted to share this out in case it helps others in their work.

I will have missed a lot of detail within this diagram, however as I remember and discover new things I will update moving forward, but for a first pass, I like it!

Should you wish, [there is a .puml file in the root of this repo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnnolan/johnnolan.dev/main/technical-architect-cheatsheet.puml) which you can take and make your own.
