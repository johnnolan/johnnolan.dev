    <blockquote>
<p>A little writeup on some fun I had creating a Google Chrome
tab plugin called &quot;Inspirational Leadership and Coaching Quotes&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>Over the past few months I have had the joy of taking part in
a self discovery course with our company UNiDAYS. I have already done
one of these before but it is nice to try a different system
and have a recap on what you have been up to. I had a thought,
random shower thought, why not have some fun and using one
of the sessions where we talked about influences and quotes
that mean something to us to make a start tab in Chrome.</p>
<p>So I did.</p>
<p>The repo to look at is here <a href="https://github.com/johnnolan/leadership-quotes-chrome-tab">https://github.com/johnnolan/leadership-quotes-chrome-tab</a></p>
<h2>How?</h2>
<p>I first went here <a href="http://extensionizr.com">http://extensionizr.com</a>
and selected the settings I needed. This tool is so simple and
since I just wanted to get up and running, this gave me a quick
way to create the boiler plate for the extension.</p>
<p>I created a very basic Gulp file, again, quick and simple to
get up and running that would take my src dir and copy all
required files for release into a new dist folder.</p>
<p>I created a bunch of icons and added these to my manifest file.
Then created a screenshot of the finished tab to upload.</p>
<p>A note on the boilerplate setup, it is missing the following
from the manifest file which is a required attribute</p>
<p><code>&quot;short_name&quot;: &quot;Inspirational Leadership Quotes&quot;,</code></p>
<p><code>shortname</code> is required so make sure you add this.</p>
<p>In <code>Override.html</code> add your html you want and add a <code>script</code>
tag to your .js file should you need it. Mine does the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>Load and parse the local json file with all the quotes and
authors in</li>
<li>Randomly selects a number from the length of quotes</li>
<li>Populates a id placeholder using jquery (which I bundled
in the file)</li>
</ul>
<p>Nice and simple.</p>
<p>For the styling I took advantage of knowing this was in Chrome
so used <code>vh</code> and <code>vw</code> values for placement of divs and
backgrounds, then <code>vw</code> for font sizes to get a dynamic font
sizing depending on the viewport size.</p>
<p>After I was done, I ran my <code>build</code> Gulp task which collected
everything and put it in a <code>dist</code> folder. Then zip up the contents
of the folder and you are ready to submit it to the Google
Chrome Extension Console.</p>
<h2>Publishing</h2>
<p>To publish your shiney new tab/extension go here</p>
<p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/dashboard">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/dashboard</a>
and click <code>Add new item</code>.</p>
<p>Upload your zip folder here and after you should find you can
fine tune your extension with a few extra options.</p>
<p>Once thing that is a bit shitty is you need to pay a one off $5
when you first submit an extension. I gather this is to deter
people from spamming so much but meh.</p>
<p>Once you are happy publish your extension, wait up to an hour
and then go show your friends, your mum and co-workers and
show them how awesome you are.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So there you go, the whole thing is quite simple to setup, except
the horrible Chrome Extension Admin Console interface, but hey,
it's functional!</p>
