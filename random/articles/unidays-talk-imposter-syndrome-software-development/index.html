<blockquote>
<p>The following is a list of notes covering my talk to our development team at UNiDAYS</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="what-is-imposter-syndrome%3F" tabindex="-1">What is Imposter Syndrome?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Impostor syndrome can be defined as a collection of feelings of<br>
inadequacy that persist even in the face of information that indicates<br>
that the opposite is true. It is experienced internally as chronic<br>
self-doubt, and feelings of intellectual fraudulence.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe nearly every person at one point in their career will feel<br>
this way. It is extremely common and just knowing about it is enough<br>
for most people to realise they have it and to start working their way<br>
out of it. Sometimes instantly.</p>
<p>I want to talk a little about it today, my experiences with it and<br>
hopefully shed some light on this condition so that others can<br>
identify and help each other in the future.</p>
<p>Learning to code is hard. It isn't a case of learning off by heart<br>
regulations for a Gas Safety Certificate or understanding the law to<br>
handle your accounts.</p>
<p>There are many different languages for you to choose and learn. You<br>
can't even choose just one as often you need to understand multiple<br>
technologies to make something work.</p>
<p>LAMP for example, or any front end development where you have a<br>
seemingly infinite amount of frameworks.</p>
<p>There is no one tool that is fit for all purposes. You will have to<br>
choose the language that best suits you and the situation.</p>
<p>This may mean having to learn a brand new language altogether to solve<br>
a particular problem.</p>
<p>So now you have rocked out of University, got a distinction and you<br>
have your first job. You walk in confident and soon realise that you<br>
know nothing.</p>
<p>Maybe you do the right thing, realise you don't know everything and<br>
start to ask questions, take your time and learn from others and<br>
find things they don't know to learn.</p>
<p>Then over the years, yes, years, you start to feel confident in<br>
general coding and things move on from there. Always knowing you will<br>
never know everything, or there will always be someone better than you.</p>
<p>Or there is the other path. You realise you don't know anything and<br>
you hide away. You spend hours on Stack Overflow (which is a good<br>
thing!) and run late on your projects.</p>
<p>You get left behind and get angry when people question why you are<br>
not completing work on time.</p>
<p>In your head, you don't deserve this role, you had better leave, you<br>
will never be as good as these guys, they use words you don't even<br>
know and complete things in hours which would take you weeks.</p>
<p>But instead of accepting you don't know that one particular thing and<br>
asking to pair programme or ask for help, again you go into your own<br>
mind and it betrays you.</p>
<p>The above is an example for university students, but if you replace<br>
university with any other condition such as new job, contracting for<br>
the first time, learning a new language, etc they can all fit.</p>
<h2 id="my-experiences-with-imposter-syndrome" tabindex="-1">My experiences with Imposter Syndrome</h2>
<p>When I first started here I felt like I had lied in the interview and<br>
the homework. Even though everything I did was my own, I still felt<br>
well out of this companies league.</p>
<p>Lead developers at the time were Dom and James. Two guys who have<br>
amazing knowledge and drive. This made me feel inadequate and very<br>
down about myself.</p>
<p>I spoke to Dom about this and when he first started he too had this<br>
feeling. The only difference is he saw what he had to learn, took<br>
action and went on courses and practised and researched until he<br>
was able to do the job he does today.</p>
<p>I struggle to learn from books. Some people can read a book and<br>
remember it, myself I would have forgotten what I read a couple of<br>
weeks later.</p>
<p>Initially, I thought this was a really bad thing and I could never<br>
get to where they are.</p>
<p>However, after a lot of self-discovery, I have realised I am a man of<br>
repetition. I need to do things practically and record them.</p>
<p>Once I do a certain thing a number of times it lodges itself in my<br>
brain, like the natural thought. Since then I spend most evenings and<br>
weekends researching and coding.</p>
<p>I also found another skill I have that I wasn't completely confident<br>
in. People. I love working with people. All I want to do each day is<br>
code cool shit and make everyone happy around me.</p>
<p>It took me too long to realise that is what drives me and that is what<br>
I am best at. Over the past six or so months I have dedicated myself<br>
to helping as many people as possible in my day to day work.</p>
<p>Off the back of that, I have learnt even more as I pair programme and<br>
solve problems with them using new technologies I have never touched<br>
before.</p>
<h2 id="so%2C-if-you-feel-at-all-like-this%2C-here-are-the-reasons-why-you-shouldn't" tabindex="-1">So, if you feel at all like this, here are the reasons why you shouldn't</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>UNiDAYS employed you.<br>
They only employee people they think are worth it and this can be<br>
proven by the interview process and homework you need to do. In the<br>
Tech Team, they have high standards and wouldn't have given you the<br>
job unless you proved you can do it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you turn up every day and try your best even though you think you<br>
aren't worthy? Yes, you do, and that is all anyone could ever ask of<br>
you. That is enough for any employer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From a personal point of view, this is the best technical minded<br>
group of people with varying degrees of skills in different<br>
technologies I have ever worked with. I love learning new things<br>
from each of you.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-can-we-work-together-to-overcome-it" tabindex="-1">How can we work together to overcome it</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Here are some paths to start on</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="get-a-mentor" tabindex="-1">Get a mentor</h3>
<p>A more experienced developer who can be your guide through any<br>
challenges you come across. They will always have time for you and be<br>
able to help you with &quot;stupid questions&quot; whenever you need, without<br>
judgement. However, this can be hard to find due to high work levels.</p>
<h3 id="get-a-peer-pair" tabindex="-1">Get a peer pair</h3>
<p>Like the above but this one is easier. Find someone else at your level<br>
who you can get to pair with and QA/Test your work giving each other<br>
constant feedback to help each other level up.</p>
<h3 id="surround-yourself-with-smart-people%2C-deal-with-it-and-take-advantage-of-it" tabindex="-1">Surround yourself with smart people, deal with it and take advantage of it</h3>
<p>The more smart people you have around you, the easier it will be to<br>
learn. The general environment will make it super easy for you to<br>
learn. Simple.</p>
<h3 id="be-curious-%2F-ask-questions" tabindex="-1">Be curious / ask questions</h3>
<p>Get together some backbone from somewhere and ask questions. This<br>
doesn't mean every time you are stuck, ask and nag people. You still<br>
get a massive sense of pride and knowledge for solving problems by<br>
reading and researching. However, if you are interested in a<br>
conversation someone is talking about, or you are up against a tight<br>
deadline then ask.</p>
<h3 id="pick-a-new-technology-and-practice" tabindex="-1">Pick a new technology and practice</h3>
<p>Just like myself, if you don't know it, learn it. Ain't no one got<br>
time for kids or the pub.</p>
<h3 id="and-finally%2C-be-aware-you-have-imposter-syndrome" tabindex="-1">And finally, be aware you have Imposter Syndrome</h3>
<p>Just knowing you have it can be enough to overcome it and get on with<br>
doing cool stuff.</p>
<h2 id="outro" tabindex="-1">Outro</h2>
<p>If you are new to UNiDAYS then our code base can seem daunting. Most<br>
of the time you can't use Stack Overflow like you can in any other job<br>
that uses popular frameworks. So you need to dig deep and learn a bit<br>
more about how things work.</p>
<p>This for me is a massive cause of Imposter Syndrome in our office,<br>
and not just our department but every department in here.</p>
<p>So guess what? Time to start getting over it! So what, you don't know<br>
how the pipeline works. Instead of saying that to yourself, try<br>
rephrasing things. Here are a few examples.</p>
<p>I don't know how this works.<br>
I don't know how this works, yet.</p>
<p>I am never going to be able to solve this problem.<br>
I wonder if anyone else has solved this problem.</p>
<p>I am going to go past the deadline date, I am going to work late<br>
tonight to show I am working hard even though I won't hit it.<br>
I am not going to hit the deadline, I better tell my line manager<br>
and ask who could pair programme with me.</p>
<p>Sounds obvious, but sometimes your mind goes into panic mode and you<br>
think it is a weakness to not know something. It isn't! It should be<br>
exciting!</p>
<p>At what point did we get in our lives where learning new things became<br>
bad? When we hack in the evenings trying something new, its great<br>
fun! When we do a hackathon, it is stressful, but an amazing sense<br>
of achievement.</p>
<p>So why at work is it such an issue? Culture? You can change that,<br>
start from today, we are a team, a team with great knowledge. Take<br>
every day you don't know something as a chance to learn something new.<br>
Be excited you don't know something!</p>
<p>So to finish, stop it. Each of you is amazing, every one of you.<br>
We are all here for individual reasons. We each bring something<br>
different to the team. That means we need to work together.</p>
<p>Keep your chin up, enjoy learning, don't be afraid and be as awesome<br>
as I know each of you is.</p>
