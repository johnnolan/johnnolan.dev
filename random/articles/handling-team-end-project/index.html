    <p>I am currently getting to the end of a 9 month project and to relieve<br>
my mind, I started writing down all the things I needed to keep doing<br>
and put in words what it meant. The below is a mind dump of some of the<br>
key things I have been doing and that I believe strongly in.</p>
<p>I love my team (and now my extended team) and am so proud of everything they<br>
have accomplished during this project. I hope the below can help other<br>
leaders who are looking for ways to feel more connecting with their<br>
colleagues as the pressure mounts.</p>
<h2 id="get-closer-to-your-teams" tabindex="-1">Get closer to your teams</h2>
<p>Now is the time to start connecting with your team more than ever. Take breaks together and let them get stresses off<br>
their chest. Listen closely and try and solve those problems for them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The less stress on their shoulders the easier it is to keep calm and focused.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="do-a-reset-on-what-is-left" tabindex="-1">Do a reset on what is left</h2>
<p>One of my favourite things is doing a reset of work. Forgetting everything done so far and going through only what is<br>
left. With a clean board, you can see the end in sight.</p>
<p>It is a small psychological boost but works really well to give people the energy to reach the end at a high velocity.</p>
<h2 id="roll-your-sleeves-up-and-get-stuck-in" tabindex="-1">Roll your sleeves up and get stuck in</h2>
<p>If like me you are lucky enough to have a development background then pair with people where it's needed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This doesn't mean micromanaging and you must not make them feel like they are underachieving.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Make yourself available and go around every person asking if there is anything you can help with.<br>
Let them know to shout if they want to work together at any time. Even have days where you<br>
just make your self available without distractions.</p>
<h2 id="communicate-with-your-team-about-everything" tabindex="-1">Communicate with your team about everything</h2>
<p>All management meetings and changes should be communicated immediately. Make your team feel as close to upper<br>
management as possible and part of the process.</p>
<p>Ownership of work and projects is essential to make people feel like they are a part of the final piece of work.</p>
<h2 id="fix-arguments-straight-away" tabindex="-1">Fix arguments straight away</h2>
<p>Passion is great if channelled correctly. Arguments can start over an interpretation of specs, inter-department<br>
beliefs, who wrote this shit code, etc.</p>
<p>Let people get their points across, but be the mediator. Things I like to try and make sure are talked about are.</p>
<ul>
<li>Facts, not feelings</li>
<li>How can these 2 points of view become a solution</li>
<li>Remind them that each has their own speciality, take the best from both arguments and make it better than before</li>
<li>After this, also make them work together for a period of time. Whether that is writing up a new amended spec or implementing<br>
something new.</li>
</ul>
<p>You need to make sure straight after one of these conflicts that working together towards the solution is done and<br>
celebrate it once complete. This will create better bonds for the future and new friendships and respect.</p>
<h2 id="be-the-calm-in-the-storm" tabindex="-1">Be the calm in the storm</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Joke about stressful situations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the pressure mounts, joke about it. Convert it into passion. Again, focus is key at this late stage and anyway<br>
you can deflect these feelings is a win.</p>
<p>Have daily inspirational quotes or phrases and make fun of it. Every day write a new cheesy quote on your team(s) board and over<br>
sell it. Maybe this is a British thing, but taking quotes seriously doesn't work for our mentality (generalisation), but it does go in.</p>
<p>Make cheesy inspiration possible by making fun of it and repeating it throughout the day when things get too much.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Center yourself</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If it gets too much for you, step out. Go for a walk and clear your mind. Refocus and come back into the room.</p>
<p>Remain calm as much as you can. You need to lead by example. Be the rock everyone needs to bounce things off to get<br>
stuff done.</p>
<h2 id="lean-on-your-team-as-much-as-they-lean-on-you" tabindex="-1">Lean on your team as much as they lean on you</h2>
<p>Don't isolate yourself. More than anything you need to keep positive,<br>
spew rainbows and keep your energy levels up.<br>
As soon as they see you start to give up, that will affect all others around you.</p>
<p>You are part of a team, you are not there to do everything yourself and look down on others,<br>
thinking you are better than them. You are one of them, it is just a title in your<br>
job description. Others know things you don't know and asking questions doesn't make<br>
you look stupid, it is humbling and makes sure you are an equal, which is exactly<br>
what you should be.</p>
<h2 id="celebrate-every-win" tabindex="-1">Celebrate every win</h2>
<p>When someone or group of people solves a problem, celebrate it. It can be high fives, hugs,<br>
beer, a quick nip out to get doughnuts or coffee. It can be anything, just make sure to savour even the smallest wins.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stay positive</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the end, the last thing people need is negativity or criticism. If you must do it, then write it down and talk about<br>
it as a group in a retrospective. Now is not the time.</p>
<p>You need to keep people energised and motivated. For every negative call out at someone, you take a part of the<br>
enthusiasm and focus with it.</p>
<p><em>Spew rainbows and do the above.</em></p>
<h2 id="closing" tabindex="-1">Closing</h2>
<p>I still muck up on the above, lose my patience or shout something bad when things build up.</p>
<p>It is also very emotionally and intellectually exhausting and every day can<br>
feel like you have ran a marathon. But remember.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are all only human.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above is my primer/beliefs of who and what I want to be.</p>
<p>Treat those around you as you would like to be treated.</p>
